            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records the changes that are made to a file, or multiple files, during all stages of development so different versions can be recalled if needed. This system provides to be very beneficial to graphic and web designers because it allows files to be reverted back to a previous stage, should there be a need. Three different types of version control systems (VCSs) include Local VCS, Centralized VCS, and Distributed VCS. Local VCS is the most simple and consists of a simple database that keeps all the changes made to files while under revision. Centralized VCS dealt with the issue of multiple collaborators on systems and this setup allows for the changes made by different people to be kept track of. Finally, Distributed VCS serves the purpose that every copy of data is a full backup meaning that if a main copy is lost, any copy can be used to replace it complete with all recent changes made.</p>

            <p class="lead">2005 marks the year Git was “founded” for lack of a better word. From 1991 to 2002, the Linux kernel, an open source software, passed any changes made to the software around as archived filed. This changed in 2002 when the Linux kernel began using a company known as BitKeeper, however this relationship soon broke down and BitKeeper’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This caused the Linux developers and creator to create their own took based on BitKeeper, which came to be known as Git. The goals of this new system included:</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two different ways to create a Git project. The first is by importing an existing project into a Git and the second copies an existing Git repository from another server.  To import an existing project, the first step is to go to the project’s directory and create a new subdirectory named “.git” that contains all of the repository files. This is done by performing a series of commands within a terminal and these commands vary based on the system you are running. By cloning an existing repository, Git receives a full copy of almost all of the data that the server has, not just a working copy. This is done with the command “git clone [url]”.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What exactly is Git? Git is different from VCSs in the way that it thinks about its data. With Git, data is thought of more like sets of snapshots and every time you save your project in Git, it essentially takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment. In order to see previous states of the projects, Git doesn’t need to go to the server to show you, it simply retrieves it directly from your local database which means you can see any point of your projects history almost instantly. Three main sections of a Git project include: the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The basic idea of how Git works: 1. You modify files in your working tree. 2. You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area. 3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within your repository, your files can either be tracked or untracked. Tracked files include anything from the last snapshot and they can be modified, unmodified, or staged. Untracked files are any other files that were not in your last snapshot or the staging area. To check the status of your file, the “git status” command is used and to begin tracking a new file, you would use the “git add” command. By running other various commands, your files can be modified, ignored, and viewed. In order to know exactly what was changed, the “git diff” command is used. The “git rm” command is used to stage the files removal from the system.</p>
